# Cyber-Writeups

Welcome to `cyber-writeups`, a repository where I share my journey and solutions through various Cybersecurity Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.
This repository serves as a personal log and a resource for others who are passionate about cybersecurity and enjoy the thrill of solving CTFs.



## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a different CTF event, with subfolders for each challenge. Inside each challenge folder, you'll find a detailed write-up explaining my approach, thought process, and how I arrived at the solution.
